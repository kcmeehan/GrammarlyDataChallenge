# Grammarly Data Challenge
This repo includes my solution to a data challenge I was given during part of the Grammarly interview process. It's my first industry-related analytics challenge and I'm pleased to say it got me to the next round of the interview. The challenge is described below. I've included both the code I used to explore the data in the notebook **MeehanGrammarlyEDACode.ipynb** as well as my final analysis and report in **MeehanGrammarlyReport.pdf**. Please feel free to send any comments, feedback and suggestions to meehan.mlsolutions at gmail. 

Analytics exercise for the Grammarly Data Challenge.

1. Plot daily active users over the month, including all users. A user is considered active if they pinged at least once on a given day.

2. Calculate the daily retention curve for users who used the app for the first time on the following dates: Feb 4th, Feb 10th, and Feb 14th.

3. Determine if there are any differences in usage based on where the users came from. From which traffic source does the app get its best users? Its worst users?
